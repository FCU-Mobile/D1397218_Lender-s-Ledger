# Build Configuration Fix

## Info.plist Conflict Resolution

The project was experiencing "Multiple commands producing the same Info.plist file" errors because:

1. The project has `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES` in build settings
2. There was also a physical Info.plist file present

**Resolution:** 
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Removed the physical Info.plist file to let Xcode generate it automatically
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Added `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSCameraUsageDescription` to build settings for QR code scanning
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Enhanced CloudKit debugging with comprehensive logging
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Created validation script to prevent future conflicts

## Changes Applied

### 1. Camera Usage Permission (QR Code Scanning)
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and configured

The original Info.plist contained:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses the camera to scan QR codes for sharing ledger items between users.</string>
```

**Solution**: Added to build settings:
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSCameraUsageDescription = "This app uses the camera to scan QR codes for sharing ledger items between users."`

### 2. Enhanced CloudKit Debugging
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

Added comprehensive logging to `CloudKitManager.swift`:
- Container initialization logging
- Detailed iCloud status checking
- Save/fetch operation logging for ledger and wishlist items
- Improved error message formatting

### 3. Build Validation Script
**Status**: ✅ Created

Run the validation script to check for conflicts:
```bash
./Scripts/validate_build_config.sh
```

## Calendar Permissions (Future Consideration)

If calendar functionality is added in the future, you may need these permissions:

- **Key:** `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` 
  **Value:** `Lender's Ledger needs calendar access to create return date reminders for your lent items.`

- **Key:** `NSCalendarsWriteOnlyUsageDescription`
  **Value:** `Lender's Ledger needs calendar access to create return date reminders for your lent items.`

Add via Build Settings:
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSCalendarsUsageDescription = Lender's Ledger needs calendar access to create return date reminders for your lent items.`
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSCalendarsWriteOnlyUsageDescription = Lender's Ledger needs calendar access to create return date reminders for your lent items.`

## Testing Results

✅ **Build Configuration**: Validated - no Info.plist conflicts
✅ **Swift Syntax**: All 9 Swift files parse correctly  
✅ **Camera Permission**: Properly configured for QR code scanning
✅ **CloudKit Logging**: Enhanced debug output implemented

The build conflict has been resolved and the project is ready for development.
